You can find the plugin [on this repos](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains) from @ChrisRM.

## TODO and Not Done
### Theming
__TODO__
* Match all the color from VSCode
* Match Highlight color

### Colourings
__TODO__
* Diff & Merge
* VCS

__NOT DONE__ (from @lenny1882)

The following have not had their colours changed, as there is no VSCode equivalent, or they require extensions for syntax highlighting (which may be opinionated).

* Cucumber
* Diagrams
* EditorConfig
* EJS
* HAML
* HTTP Request
* JSP
* RegExp
* Stylus
* XPath
* Spy-js

## Disclaimer
The vast majority of work has been done with WebStorm open next to VSCode and its DevTools, selecting elements in VSCode and copying colour values where WebStorm does not match. As such, neither colourings nor theme are an exact replica (and never will be - VSCode and WebStorm handle a lot of things differently. VSCode, for example, offers far more granular syntax highlighting).

This project is maintained, as WebStorm is my favorite IDE. Pull requests are welcome.
